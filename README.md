- This file was constructed as proof of completion of the day planner assignment.
- Users can enter necessary tasks into the time slot and save them to a local storage
- once the input is complete the computer will update the website with colors to help determine if the time has passed, is currently passing, or has come to pass.
- this assignment tested my patience and i'm ready to throw my computer out the window

- anyways. Live link to the website is here: https://cmokbel1.github.io/Day-Planner/
