This file was constructed as proof of completion of the day planner assignment.
Users can enter necessary tasks into the time slot and save them to a local storage
once the input is complete the computer will update the website with colors to help determine if the time has passed, is currently passing, or has come to pass.
this assignment tested my patience and i'm ready to throw my computer out the window because the person i sought help from did not help at all and only gave me anecdotal information to use in my search for resources.
great job ask bcs (pun intended)

anyways. Live link to the website is here:
have at it!
